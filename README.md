# Weather Application
This project is an application to check the accurate weather conditions of a place at a particular time.


I built this application to learn about the APIs and JavaScript.

-During the process of building this project, I learned about how to use API Keys to fetch real-time data from a website[openweather.org].

-I learned about how to make simple calls using JavaScript.

-I learned how to incoroperate real-time dates in an application.


#Features in the Application.

-Accurate temperature, humidity and wind-speed.

-Current day,month and year.

-Current weather description and image icon.


Limitation

_The app is not 100per reponsive in some mobile devices, it zooms out immediately you enter the landing page, need to be ajusted/zoom in to render properly.
