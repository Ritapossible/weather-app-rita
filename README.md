# Weather Application
This project is an application to check the accurate weather conditions of a place at a particular time.


I built this application to learn about the APIs and JavaScript.

1. During the process of building this project, I learned about how to use API Keys to fetch real-time data from a website[openweather.org].

2. I learned about how to make simple calls using JavaScript.

3. I learned how to incoroperate real-time dates in an application.


 Features in the Application.

1. Accurate temperature, humidity and wind-speed.

2. Current day,month and year.

3. Current weather description and image icon.


Limitation

1. The app is not 100per reponsive in some mobile devices, it zooms out immediately you enter the landing page, need to be ajusted/zoom in to render properly.
